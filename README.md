# Poetry_Study_Music_Interact_Bot
## Description
This project creates a bot that can be used to automate many desktop operations vis:
* Playing using.
* Poetry 
  * That is displaying in fantastic way and editing poems.
  * Each poem is displayed alongside a song that tells more about the mood of the poem.
  * Once a new poem has been added the diaplay is edited automatically.
* Devotion.
  * Daily verses are displayed.
  * Devotions are recorded in the same way as poems.
  * Easy to keep track of daily devotions.
  
* Music.
  * Songs are played alongside their lyrics.
  
* Health Check.
  * This is still being worked on.
  * But the end goal is coming up with a system than can access and know the mood of a person and thus give some pychological guidance.
  
* Some fun patterns.
  * These are simple `c++` programs that print patterns/shapes like diamond, house and many others.
* One can interact with the bot.
