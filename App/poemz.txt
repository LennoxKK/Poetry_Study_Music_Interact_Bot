~$~poem1 And Is It Among Rude Untutored Dales 

AND is it among rude untutored Dales,
There, and there only, that the heart is true?
And, rising to repel or to subdue,
Is it by rocks and woods that man prevails?
Ah no! though Nature's dread protection fails,
There is a bulwark in the soul. This knew
Iberian Burghers when the sword they drew
In Zaragoza, naked to the gales
Of fiercely-breathing war. The truth was felt
By Palafox, and many a brave compeer,
Like him of noble birth and noble mind;Y
By ladies, meek-eyed women without fear;
And wanderers of the street, to whom is dealt
The bread which without industry they find.


By William Wordsworth

~$~poem2 The end of the foot path

Begins as a clear wake without grass
It lies as an impeccable way 
So lucrative not to send one away
Still on the road I stood and reckoned
Being avaricious I was compelled
_leave the main road and follow the foot
 path 
Exuberantly I trod
The land twice, the power twice and wealth 
twice 
_twice what others will get 
Gradually the path turned grassy 
From flat to rugged, and finally thorny
Then it got lost and too I got lost
From morning to evening I wondered in the 
forest for exit
Finally, I got to the main road bruised with
 lassitude 
I couldn’t go for my share while others 
made it 
Met them going back home with handfuls 
I lied down writhing in pain and agony 
I reckoned vividly later on
If I were to get everything then my fellow 
Would have gotten nothing
Then calculating nothing two times!
I ended up with nothing!

~$~poem3 I had fun with you


Excitement arose and I smiled broadly 
Out of bereavement I laughed sadly 
Used to be hallucinations 
And now it had come to reality 
In the vicinity of your love I faltered
You made me enjoy your sweet kisses 
Your hugs left me with wishes 
And you went!!
Away you went 
I had fun but my meagre pain multiplied into infinite 
Brief happiness had begotten eternal sorrow
Reminiscing I regret
It wasn’t love it was lust
Girl you left me a black mark which will last forever

~$~poem4 Moonlight


From far away behind the rocks 
Yeah just behind the house blocks 
Still the moonlight knocks 
For its true that the black shocks
Yeah, ready and with time it strikes
Slowly it crawls and the black it mocks 
Just for the untrodden paths it breaks  
Into the newness of untouched grass and
 reveal the hidden paths 
A glare is seen as it penetrates the 
holes of the walls made of sacks 
The faces covered with masks 
No opening for the eyes 
Light cant be seen the disease 
Some still in darkness, they don’t cease
Cease from their wickedness 
and find the light
Then moonlight comes upon their 
lives one day
Yeah those who during sunshine laid hay
And darkness is no more,
the moonlight dominates their nights 
and together they will say 
“Those who suffer are those 
who don’t trust and obey
Yeah, adoring the Lord is a source
 of relief..
and the Lords place is the dazzling 
place forever..

~$~poem5 Mama

Just a look at the myriad of scars you bared for me to grow 
To accommodate me, to rubble you had to bend low
Through pain and torture the seed in me you sow 
Can’t the sacrifices you made for me against the foe 
No one I ever seen 
Of light or dark skin
To compare with you my lovely mum 
Greatest among all 
From north to the south pole 
To goodness let it be done 
You are of fortune 
Proud of what you venture in agony 
Yes, your gain makes the world shine 
As greatest legendary records are broken
What a lovely and contented mother
One to cling ion and never seek another 
Incredible and sane mother 
Yes, you are my great mother

~$~poem6 Never Quit 


It is dawn again, sunshine enlightens darkness 
What was sown wrought frown, not in a crown but down 
Struggling, trying and kicking have merely yielded destruction 
Never say goodbye if you still want to try
Struggle, stumble, and be humble. Never quit 
Strive tirelessly and relentlessly for there is hope after every stop
 
Just show a beautiful game you will be a winner 
Assured of celebration after every frustration
Failure means delay but not defeat
Crave and believe you will receive victory, never quit

When the storm exceeds no pavement and no movement out of shame 
World against you, nothing, no one on your side 
Stay focused storm will turn inside out into success and fame 
Winners never quit but keep on moving 
Nothing to hold you behind if you know your strong hold

~$~poem7 Truth


Hitherto the gap is still arcane 
The gap between comprehension and life 
So difficult for men to cross this cliff
Just to make it make it brief
Reality the bridge to revelation is 
demolished 
Time has elapsed but chaos still exists
World has become like a rough sea 
Accustomed to darkness never to seek exit
Many have preferred the false world and
 forgone the bitter truth
Things have lost their authenticity
People learn how to fake right from birth
And think their fragile hearts cannot 
 withstand
_the bruising truth_
Alternatively dodging intolerable truth
It doesn’t hurt to accept lies
But very painful to decipher where the 
truth lies 
_world trembling, world shaking_
Crisis has dominated many states, kingdom
 and territories 
_corruption beheads the innocent 
Reality the bridge to understanding is 
broken
Those steering the wheel 
…and in charge speak of peace and love
But drink human blood to stay in power
Preach about pure water 
But their cups full of wine which is
 ‘softer’
In their hands love and harmony
_in their pockets the venom

~$~poem8 I am no one else 


Kindness left me nothing 
And humility so humiliating 
Silence wrought bruises and sentimental torture
Suffering from whips and insults mixture
But when I opened my big mouth I was detained 
When I was strict solely, I remained 

My parents not loving again
My brothers and sisters no longer sane 
Friends became extortioners of my property
My wife a harlot 

I am a scapegoat to the sins of my children
They kill maim and skin men alive to gain
The boss avarice, pastor hypocrite and the judge a drunkard 
And God’s word tells me to be myself and not afraid

~$~poem9 Letter to a son 

Son, get me right 

When you see the journey too grueling 
Fuel your vessel more than enough 
When your journey reaches a gruesome point
Don’t run away the problem to aggravate 
Slow down cautiously and get yourself ready, 
Slowing down will rejuvenate your strength
 as your courage compile, momentum 
Never give up son
Never terminate or make the journey stop
Continue moving, never quit 
Avoid shortcuts and terminable footpaths
_there is no other simpler way than the
 hardest way made simple 
_there is no other shorter path than the 
actual path made short
There is nothing simpler than to start a 
journey with a lot of preparation 
Believe and emulate none
Sieve after learning 
Let today be different from yesterday

~$~poe10 A letter to the child

Rise and walk into the world 

Silver and gold, I don’t have but what I have I will give 
Rise and walk
Walk majestically with enthusiasm 
Be cautioned, speed matters not 
Direction matters a lot 
Rise and walk into the world where there is pain from swords and words
Laughter and happiness only from your God 
You don’t belong again to my cave 
Childish frivolity is now out of you, no longer a captive 
_of my strictness and principles like chains 
The whole world will rebuke teach and chasten you
Take care!
Whatever you purchase from the world guarantees not happiness 
Not all friends are kind, some will just reap from you 
Be wise distinguish the truth and lies
Stand by your ego firmly
Believe in it and pursue relentlessly
Rise and walk into the world

~$~poe11 Fire Burning

Experiences can be tamed
Into a delicious bread pain can be baked
The heart automaticaly loves and gets excited
But the ability to hundle pain, rejection and defeat is cultivated
For rerouting our vessels sadness is meant
Seen the tearsoaked clothes? Bleeding heart? Burnt hut?
The decision to change course?
Slowly from the ground they rise and dust off their coats.
Dedicated to meet any kind of newness.
Another trial, a new dive into happiness
The voice of victory, the voice of triumph
From west, east , south and north the wind blows
With strength hitting the sores
Blinding the nerves to neither to see nor transmit the aches
Moving and focusing on the small possibility of winning
Keeping the fire burning, strength consumed but quiting never a choice
Close to the finishing line and the piece of wood
Consumed to the handle
pain on the hands holding it
Fear of seeing the light going off
The urge to drop the fire!
The silent prayer
The sound of care telling you to see the finishing line
And Jesus beckons
Come let's dine

~$~poe12 SCRIPT OF PLAY

COLLOSIANS

Paul is taken to jail at the start of the play 
(He is being pushed and harshly treated)
Paul Contemplates on whether to write to the "free people" 
Or not to write because it was them who were supposed to console him
Still he gains strength and allows the Holy Spirit to guide him
Since its in jail( Pual borrows a pen and a paper from one of
the wardeners)
He starts writing a letter to the collosians 
to guide them on how to approach christianity.

Observing old laws and ceremonies

#~$~poe13 The moment is here.

I see the rivers flooding.
The deluge,
Nothing destroyed.
Dry streams in the desert are now overflowing.
Greenness allover.
All the blood shed washed away.
Masters bow down as slaves take charge.
Drowning into this rivers of overflowing blessings.
Drenched by the blood of Christ.
My eyes wide open as i watch the heavens.
The Flood gates!
The Flood gates are wide open!
The moment is here, 
My focus unto the Lord,
 "Don't let it pass."
A whisper to my heart.
I stay mesmerised!
Tears down my face!
A new day has come.
Too late but too soon!
Everything at hand, the long waited miracle.
~$~poe14 A HANDLE FOR PAIN

Tried mahogany from the forest.
And bamboo from the ocean.
None could make a good handle for my pain.
Still wondering, Is my quest right?
Or is pain hot?
Or is pain sharp to prick my heart?
Is it possible to hold pain by its handle?
So that I don't hurt anymore in its vicinity
Yeah, Iam trying to make one.
Neither metals were good for this task.
Even  gold which shines in the dark
could not fit.
Pain! Pain! Pain!
The mentor, the Counsellor both are victims.
Pain made them shade tears.
Even Jesus wept! Because of pain!
~$~poe15 A Moment like this.

Psalms 42:11
Why are you downcast, Oh my soul?
Why so disturbed within me?
Put your hope in God for I will praise him,
my Savior and my God.

My heart have been crying for peace?
For long I have been yearning for bliss!
I mean, a moment like this!
A moment like this!
A moment to thank my God and speak like this!
Have never again felt like this!
Down on my knees, I surrender it all.
Have been to many churches, palaces, luxury places name them.
None of them made me feel as I feel right now!
Things turned inside out.
Pornography done away with.
Dirty thoughts done away with.
Gossip done away with.
selfishness  done away with.
Pride done away with.
Poverty done away with.
Fear, no longer my master.
The whole burden is no longer on my back.
I remember the sleepless nights, and tearful days.
Being a slave to my own thoughts.
Lonely nights, doing my best to hide my struggles.
Swollen eyes as cried in silence for the addiction to go away.
suicidal thoughts when she had to heartbreak me and go away.
Fear of not achieving my dreams due to lack of fees.
Struggling through it alone, no one to help.
When I had given up, saying it's done!
You held my hand and whispered," It has begun!"
Right in your presence! aside never to turn.
Love in its freshness, joy in its fullness
Been longing for a moment like this.
Just to say thank you!
For I don't know, how and why you saved me.
